This is a small Python/Flask app that will retrieve weather information.  It uses a free API from https://openweathermap.org/api. You'll need to obtain a key from OpenWeatherMap.

To run locally you'll need to:

cd into /MyWeatherApp folder
export FLASK_APP=main.py
flask run

This will let you run on your localhost on port 5000
