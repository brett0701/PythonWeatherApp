This is a small Python/Flask app that will retrieve weather information.  It uses a free API from https://openweathermap.org/api. You'll need to obtain a key from OpenWeatherMap.

Python and pip must be installed on your computer
Make a folder called MyWeatherApp.
Clone the files to this folder.
Then run:  pip install -r requirements.txt

To run locally you'll need to:

cd into /MyWeatherApp folder
export FLASK_APP=main.py
flask run

This will let you run on your localhost on port 5000
